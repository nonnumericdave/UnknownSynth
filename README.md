# UnknownSynth
A very basic sinusoidal, polyphonic, multi-touch synth in the style of Joy Division's "Unknown Pleasures."  Literally.

### Description
Unfortunately, this was originally crafted using OpenGL many years ago.  At some point, I may update it to use Metal.

### Requirements
In order to build this project, you will need to install the JUCE framework and generate an Xcode project from the JUCE project.
